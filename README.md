# UX-UI-Week1-FizzBuzz

# Fizzbuzz Loop Challenge

Create the fizzbuzz function: 

The goal of this function is to print out all numbers from 1 to 100 but with  three exceptions: 

For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log "FizzBuzz". For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log "Fizz". For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console .log "Buzz". 

Here is a partial example with numbers from 12 to 20: 

... 

"Fizz" 

13 

14 

"FizzBuzz" 

16 

17 

"Fizz" 

19 

"Buzz" 

... 

Hint:  

Start with this for-loop: 

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { 

…your code… 

}

Week 1 Project 

You are required to do a to-do list website using HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. If you don’t know what a to-do list is you can read this:  

What is a To-do List? The definition is a simple one. It’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do. 

Most typically, they’re organized in order of priority. Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post-it notes and act as a memory aid.
